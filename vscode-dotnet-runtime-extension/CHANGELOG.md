## [Unreleased]
## [1.8.1] - 2023-09-18

Don't report failure if the .NET we try to uninstall is in use, and mark it to be uninstalled again next time, as before, we would not attempt to uninstall again later.

## [1.8.0] - 2023-09-18

Relies on node.arch() to determine .NET installation architecture for local runtimes instead of architecture-related environment variables.
This is to fix ia32/32-bit VS Code versions having an x64 terminal and then installing x64 dotnet when x32 dotnet runtimes are desired.

Installs before this version will be cleaned up, removed, and replaced with an architecture specific version. But this will only occur when a new runtime request is made for the same version, and the old version can thus be replaced by an architecture-specific copy.

## [1.7.4] - 2023-08-24

Don't read registry for proxy lookup if permission is unavailable to do so, requires manual proxy setting in this case.

## [1.7.3] - 2023-08-24

Fixes an issue where install script files could have race conditions by introducing file locking mechanisms.
Adds proxy detection & support that forwards calls through a proxy to axios. This is to fix a bug in axios where it does not handle proxies correctly.
Attempts to discover powershell in more ways in case it's been removed from the PATH, or try using powershell core if only that is available.
Improves file permissions handling to prevent issues on mac and linux where install script files may not have the correct permissions to execute.
Remarks in error messages how users in China may experience timeouts or offline errors due to GFW blocking our download pages.

## [1.7.2] - 2023-08-24

This release completely revamps the web request handling to a new library (axios).

## [1.7.1] - 2023-08-24

This is a small release that changes the error handling and issue reporting experience to make it easier to submit issues with the information we need to properly triage them. It also updates some package dependencies and increases timeout time.

## [1.7.0] - 2023-08-14

This is a small release with a targeted set of fixes derived from user reports in the past week or so.

### Added

- A new error type for when the user tries to install via the Powershell install script on a system where powershell cannot be found [#1212]
- A new error type for when an install was requested but already exists locally [#1212]
- New APIs for querying SDK installations and suggested SDK versions [#791]

### Fixed

### Changed
