        Our log files are located alongside VS Code logs. If you want to find them manually, navigate here:
        Linux: ~/.config/Code/logs
        Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/logs/
        Windows: c:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Code\logs\

        Then find the folder created at the time you experienced the bug in the logs folder.
        From there, go to window1 -> exthost -> ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime. The log file should be located in this folder.

        Note: The window folder may change depending on how many VS Code windows you have open; if our extension is running in the 2nd window, it'd be in a folder called window2.
    placeholder: The log file location should be copied to your clipboard if you came from VS Code.
